Do "mr update" to clone or update all Git repositories listed in this repository.

See .mrconfig for the actual list.

The "mr" command is shipped in the "mr" Debian package.


~/.mrtrust
----------

Since we do execute some commands after update/checkout (specifically: ensuring
pre-commit hooks exist where needed), you will need to tell mr that you "trust"
the .mrconfig used by swh-environment. If in doubt, open
swh-environment/.mrconfig and review the commands listed there.

To trust the .mrconfig, do something like the following:

    cd swh-environment
    echo `pwd`/.mrconfig >> ~/.mrtrust


PYTHONPATH
----------

We use several Python modules, that should all be in the PYTHONPATH to be
found. To that extent, we provide in this repository a script to set the
PYTHONPATH variable to the correct value. You can use it as follows:

    . pythonpath.sh


Initialize a new Python package repository
------------------------------------------

1. create the remote Git repository on the forge

2. add it to `.mrconfig` (e.g. using mr register)

3. mr update

   this will clone the (empty) repository locally

4. bin/init-py-repo REPO_NAME

   this will fill the repository with the template for SWH Python packages, and
   make an initial commit

5. cd REPO_NAME ; git push
