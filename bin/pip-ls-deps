# WARNING: CRUDE HACK in the pipeline above. 'pip3 install' will fail if the
# same package name appears multiple times, e.g., as both "django" and "django
# >= 1.10.7" rather than trying to determine (when possible) a comprehensive
# constraint.  So we deduplicate here, by first sorting alphabetically which
# will (generally...) put higher dependency constraints last and then
# deduplicate using the sole package name as key. In the example above this
# should only keep "django >= 1.10.7" and get rid of "django".
